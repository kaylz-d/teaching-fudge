I made this for https://fudge.hackclub.com :)
Initially, I wanted to deploy it with Coolify, but was struggling a lot (hence the many commits), so I switched to Railway and all of my problems were solved (^_^)b

I was just gonna keep it simple by embedding some widgets, but got the sudden urge to finally learn how to use an API (T_T)

### Special thanks to Kat for struggling through the Hackatime API back duing Parthenon. I referred to [her code](https://github.com/joysudo/catatime) to fix my own code (๑•̀ ᴗ•́)૭✧
